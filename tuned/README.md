# Tuned Package

A Skyhook package for managing the `tuned` system tuning daemon on Linux systems. This package provides automated installation, configuration, and management of tuned profiles for system performance optimization.

## Overview

[Tuned](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned) is a daemon that uses udev to monitor connected devices and statically and dynamically tunes system settings according to a selected profile. This package automates the deployment and configuration of tuned across different Linux distributions.

## Features

- **Multi-distribution support**: Works on Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS/RHEL/Amazon Linux, and Fedora
- **Custom profile management**: Deploy and apply custom tuned profiles via configmaps
- **Idempotent operations**: Safe to run multiple times without side effects
- **Comprehensive validation**: Built-in checks for installation and configuration status
- **Service lifecycle management**: Handles installation, configuration, and uninstallation
- **Handles Necessary Interrupts**: Handles reboots and service restarts around important workloads for specific tuning parameters that require it.

- **CentOS/RHEL/Amazon Linux**: Uses `yum` package manager
- **Fedora**: Uses `dnf` package manager

## Package Modes

### Installation Modes

#### `apply` / `upgrade`
- **Script**: `install_tuned.sh`
- **Purpose**: Installs the tuned package and starts/enables the service
- **Actions**:
  - Updates package repositories
  - Installs tuned package
  - Enables and starts tuned service
  - Displays service status

#### `apply-check` / `upgrade-check`
- **Script**: `install_tuned_check.sh`
- **Purpose**: Validates successful tuned installation
- **Checks**:
  - `tuned` command availability
  - `tuned-adm` command availability
  - Service is running (`systemctl is-active`)
  - Service is enabled for boot (`systemctl is-enabled`)

### Configuration Mode

#### `config`
- **Script**: `apply_tuned_profile.sh`
- **Purpose**: Deploys custom profiles and applies the specified tuned profile
- **Process**:
  1. Creates custom profile directories in `/etc/tuned/`
  2. Copies configmap files as `tuned.conf` for each custom profile
  3. Reads the target profile from `tuned_profile` configmap file
  4. Applies the specified profile using `tuned-adm profile`

#### `config-check`
- **Script**: `apply_tuned_profile_check.sh`
- **Purpose**: Validates profile configuration
- **Checks**:
  - Tuned service is running
  - Configmaps directory exists
  - Custom profiles are properly deployed
  - Correct profile is active and verified
  - Profile verification via `tuned-adm verify` (behavior controlled by `INTERRUPT` variable)

### Uninstallation Mode

#### `uninstall`
- **Script**: `uninstall_tuned.sh`
- **Purpose**: Removes tuned package and disables service
- **Actions**:
  - Disables and stops tuned service
  - Removes tuned package
  - Cleans up unused dependencies (apt only)

#### `uninstall-check`
- **Script**: `uninstall_tuned_check.sh`
- **Purpose**: Validates successful tuned removal
- **Checks**:
  - `tuned` command is not available
  - `tuned-adm` command is not available
  - Service is stopped
  - Service is disabled

## Recovery Mode

#### `post-interrupt-check`
- **Script**: `post_interrupt_tuned_check.sh`
- **Purpose**: Validates system state after interrupt (reboot/service restart)
- **Checks**: Performs comprehensive validation of tuned state, including mandatory `tuned-adm verify` (always enforced regardless of `INTERRUPT` variable)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### INTERRUPT

The `INTERRUPT` environment variable controls how the package handles `tuned-adm verify` failures during different validation phases:

- **Purpose**: Determines whether to fail on `tuned-adm verify` errors in the config-check step
- **Values**:
  - `true`: Allow config-check to pass even if `tuned-adm verify` fails (recommended for tunings requiring an interrupt)
  - `false` or unset: Fail config-check if `tuned-adm verify` fails (default behavior)
- **When to use**: Set to `true` when applying tuning profiles that require an interrupt to take effect and verify correctly
- **Behavior**:
  - **config-check step**: If `INTERRUPT=true`, verification failures are logged as warnings but don't cause the step to fail
  - **post-interrupt-check step**: Always fails on verification errors regardless of INTERRUPT setting (tunings should be verifiable after an interrupt)

**Example configuration in SCR:**
```yaml
env:
    name: INTERRUPT
    value: true
```

### Configmaps

The package expects configmaps to be available in `${SKYHOOK_DIR}/configmaps/`:

#### Required Configmaps

- **`tuned_profile`**: Contains the name of the tuned profile(s) to apply. Supports multiple space-separated profiles for merged configurations.
  ```
  # Single profile example
  balanced
  
  # Multiple profiles example (settings from later profiles take precedence)
  throughput-performance network-latency
  ```

#### Optional Configmaps

- **Custom profile files**: Any files in the configmaps directory (except `tuned_profile` and `*_script` files) will be treated as custom tuned profile configurations
  - File name becomes the profile name
  - File contents become the `tuned.conf` for that profile
  - Files are deployed to `/etc/tuned/<profile_name>/tuned.conf`

- **Script files**: Any files ending with `_script` will be deployed as executable scripts to `/etc/tuned/scripts/`
  - File name pattern: `<name>_script` (e.g., `setup_script`, `my_optimization_script`)
  - Scripts are deployed to `/etc/tuned/scripts/<name>` (the `_script` suffix is removed)
  - Scripts are automatically made executable (`chmod +x`)
  - Can be referenced in tuned profiles using the `[script]` plugin

### Example Custom Profile

```ini
# configmaps/my-custom-profile
[main]
summary=Custom performance profile for my application

[cpu]
governor=performance
energy_perf_bias=performance

[disk]
readahead=4096

[vm]
transparent_hugepages=never
```

### Example Custom Profile with Scripts

```ini
# configmaps/ai-optimized-profile
[main]
summary=AI/ML optimized profile with custom scripts

[cpu]
governor=performance
energy_perf_bias=performance

[script]
type=script
script=/etc/tuned/scripts/ai_setup

[vm]
transparent_hugepages=always
```

```bash
# configmaps/ai_setup_script
#!/bin/bash
# This script will be deployed to /etc/tuned/scripts/ai_setup

echo "Setting up AI/ML optimizations..."

# Configure GPU memory settings
if [ -d /sys/class/drm ]; then
    echo "Configuring GPU settings for AI workloads"
    # Add GPU-specific optimizations here
fi

# Set up NUMA topology optimizations
echo "Configuring NUMA settings for AI workloads"
for node in /sys/devices/system/node/node*; do
    if [ -d "$node" ]; then
        echo 0 > "$node/compact"
    fi
done

echo "AI optimization setup complete"
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Installation
Deploy the package with apply mode to install tuned with default settings.

### Custom Profile Deployment
1. Create configmap files with your custom tuned profiles
2. Create a `tuned_profile` configmap specifying which profile to activate
3. Deploy the package with config mode to apply the custom configuration

            [disk]
            readahead=4096                   # bigger readahead for large dataset loads

            [vm]
            transparent_hugepages=always     # large pages help with tensor allocations
            swappiness=10                    # avoid swapping under load
        ai_init_script: |-
            #!/bin/bash
            # Custom AI/ML initialization script
            echo "Initializing AI/ML optimizations..."
            
            # Configure GPU memory pools
            if command -v nvidia-smi >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                echo "Configuring NVIDIA GPU settings"
                nvidia-smi -pm 1  # Enable persistence mode
            fi
            
            # Set up memory allocation patterns for AI workloads
            echo "Configuring memory allocation for AI workloads"
            echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
            
            echo "AI initialization complete"
```

This example demonstrates:
- **Node targeting**: Using `nodeSelectors` to target specific node groups
- **Interrupt handling**: Configuring reboot interrupts for kernel-level changes
- **Environment variables**: Setting `INTERRUPT=true` to handle verification during config changes
- **Custom profiles**: Creating hierarchical profiles with `include` directive
- **Custom scripts**: Using `_script` configmaps to deploy executable scripts
- **Script integration**: Referencing deployed scripts in profiles using the `[script]` plugin
- **AI/ML optimizations**: Performance settings optimized for machine learning workloads
- **Kernel parameters**: Using `[sysctl]` and `[bootloader]` sections for low-level tuning

### Available Tuned Profiles

Common built-in profiles include:
- `balanced` - Default balanced profile
- `powersave` - Power saving profile
- `throughput-performance` - Maximum throughput
- `latency-performance` - Low latency optimization
- `network-latency` - Network latency optimization
- `network-throughput` - Network throughput optimization

Use `tuned-adm list` to see all available profiles on your system or go to [tuned profiles](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/tree/master/profiles) to see the profiles which are automatically installed with tuned.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service fails to start**
   - Check system logs: `journalctl -u tuned`
   - Verify package installation: `rpm -q tuned` or `dpkg -l tuned`

2. **Profile not found**
   - List available profiles: `tuned-adm list`
   - Check custom profile deployment in `/etc/tuned/`

3. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure scripts run with appropriate privileges
   - Check `/etc/tuned/` directory permissions

4. **Verification errors**
   - Check verification: `tuned-adm verify`
   - Verify correct active profile: `tuned-adm active`
   - Check verification logs in `/var/log/tuned/tuned.log`
   - For tunings requiring reboot: Set `INTERRUPT=true` to allow config-check to pass despite verification failures

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Check tuned status
systemctl status tuned

# List available profiles
tuned-adm list

# Check active profile
tuned-adm active

# Verify profile recommendations
tuned-adm recommend

# Verify tuning has finished
tuned-adm verify
```
